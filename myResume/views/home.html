            <p>Hello,
                my name is William Rainey, I am 26 years old and eager for work. I was born
                and raised in Birmingham, AL. I am an Eagle Scout, which I got at the age
                of 17. I enjoy crappie fishing, wood working, and helping others out in my
                free time with no intentions of payment. I am a very hard worker and I do
                my best to be a fast learner.  
            </p>

            <h2 class="fontz text-center header">Work Experience</h2>
            <p>For most of my life I have had hard labor based jobs. With this being said,
                it is not to say that this is my limitation on the type of work that I can 
                perform. For 10 1/2 weeks I attended the Depot/U front end developer bootcamp,
                which is located inside of the Innovation Depot building in downtown Birmingham.
                I am capable of using html/css, javascript, angularjs, and bootstrap.
            </p>

            <h2 class="fontz text-center header">Education</h2>
            <p>I am a graduate of Hoover High School, I went to college at the University
                of North Alabama for approximately 2 1/2 years until complications brought
                me back home. While I was there I was working towards a bachelors in Computer
                Information Systems with a minor of Computer Science. I graduated from the 
                Depot/U front end developer bootcamp on April 29, 2016.
